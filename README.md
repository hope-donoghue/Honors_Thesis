Abstract: 
Currently, the NCAA uses a metric called Rating Percentage Index (RPI) to rate teams in women’s soccer. RPI considers a team’s strength of schedule in addition to their number of wins and losses. Is this metric the most effective way to rate a team in soccer? This project aims to compare various rating methods for ranking Division III women’s soccer teams. The rating methods used in this project are: RPI, Elo (originally developed for chess) and a model based on Poisson scoring rates. An interactive Shiny App, either sorted by region or league, displays the ratings generated by each method for the respective teams. We then simulate results for many seasons with known team abilities to compare how each rating method performs.
